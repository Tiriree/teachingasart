My Learning (how do I learn something?)

I learn when I really focus on that thing. So how i focus on that? it means when I am in the present. This is the same as how I do a meditation too. I was influenced by its practice of a deep critical realization of our spontaneous reaction to all surroundings. You do not need to be just in the quiet place to do mediation but need to have self awareness and know what you are doing now. During the class, If the instructor says the method clearly, I can learn very well too. Also one more thing that help me to learn a lot is when I fail, the mistake made me know how bad am I and what I should pay attention more. 

The discussion during the class keeps me concentrate, also it gives me a space to think about what I am doing now. Am I loss? what is that for? those questions keep me back on track.
